  original: Concentration parameters for trace metalloid elements and inorganic selenium
    species in water occupying the space between sediment grains. Trace metalloids
    are considered as B, Ge, As, Sb, Te, and Po (but not Si which is classed separately
    because of its major role in environmental chemistry).
