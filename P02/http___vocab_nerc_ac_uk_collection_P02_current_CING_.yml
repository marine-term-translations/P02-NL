  original: Concentrations of inorganic carbon in the particulate phase of the water
    column as extracted by a fitration technique.  This is the particle-bound concentration
    per unit volume of the water column. Consequently, it is both a function of the
    SPM concentration in the water column and the concentration of inorganic carbon
    per unit weight of the SPM.
