  original: Concentration parameters for metalloid elements in sediment.  Sediment
    is understood to be the solid phase of the bed, including the recently settled
    material sometimes known as fluff collected from the bed surface. Metalloids are
    considered as B, Ge, As, Sb, Te and Po (but not Si which is classed separately
    because of its major role in environmental chemistry)
