  original: Concentrations of total and organic carbon in the particulate phase of
    the water column as extracted by a filtration technique. This is the particle-bound
    concentration per unit volume of the water column and is both a function of the
    SPM concentration in the water column and the concentration of carbon per unit
    weight of SPM.  Total and organic carbon are classed together to circumvent confusion
    caused by total carbon data sets labelled 'POC' on the assumption that the inorganic
    carbon fraction is negligible
